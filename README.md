# KingsCounty-HomeSales

This data visualization project features home sales data from Kings County, Washington. Users can learn trends of home sales from 2014-2015. I created a calander widget as the primary filter, and additional filters based on year of build, square footage living, and square foot lot. The dashboard features six additional visuals illustrating metrics such as the daily average of home price, distribution of bedrooms, and condition of the home.
